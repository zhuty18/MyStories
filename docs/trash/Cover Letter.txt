We are applying for the visa subclass 600, for the purpose of group tourism. We plan to stay in Australia for 9 natural days, from 2024-02-17 to 2024-02-25. We will arrive in Sydney and leave from Sydney. We will stay in Gold Coast for 5 days, Brisbane for 2 days and Sydney for 1 day, all will be in hotels. Last day is the day we leave Australia by air so we will not stay in any hotel.

# Who am I?

## Tianyao Zhu

I have just reached the end of my master programme in Cardiff University. However, as you may know, finishing study period does not equal to graduation. Until this moment, my dissertation is not marked yet. So though my proof of enrolment says my programme expected to end in Sep. 2023, I do not have any degree or graduation papers.

After finished study period, I started looking for a job. I joined 点点互动 (Century Games) as a game designer intern in Nov. 2023. Our contract is I can only be hired as official employee when I can provide the proof of my master degree. Game designer is my dream job so I accept those terms. It's a excellent company with lots of benefits, which extends to interns like me. I plan to work in Century Games for at least three years.

Since I'm in Internet business, my salary is satisfying and can cover this trip with the budget of 5,000 AUD. My proof of deposit is funded by my parents as a "rainy day" money in case of emergency, which was gifted to me before I went to Britain for studying. And I'm proud to say that I didn't touch a single penny of it because I'm a well-organised person that can manage myself. Even with the six-week trip across Britain I had before I went back home, which I arranged all by myself, I stayed within my budget and totally enjoyed the trip. My parents were so impressed by how I handled myself, that they agreed I have all grown up and trusted me to make my own plans. They said I can decide how to use the "rainy day" money now, so I'm using it as a proof of deposit now.

## 【小鳄鱼】

I have just graduated from 【学校】 in postgraduate of 【专业】, ended 18 years of student life. I took an internship in 【公司】 for 1 month and just finished it. I admit I took the internship too recklessly because I was afraid of not having anything serious to do. However, this job is not what I want to do in the future. It's full of ordinary and repetitive work, which makes me start to doubt the value of myself. I realized studying is exhausting and working in a unsuitable place is even more horrible. So I decided to take a break, have a gap season to travel and meet people and re-start looking for a job after I know what exactly I want to do.

My parents are supportive to my decision. Even though they held great expectation to my future, they cared about my mental health more. They would support me financially and emotionally.

## 【夜哥】

I am a PhD student in 【学校】 majoring in 【专业】. I have been studying in 【学校】 for 【学习年限】 years. Getting PhD is stressful and recently my stress has been accumulated to a point that start to affect my physical health. I had to stay in hospital for a week to recover from somatization. Everybody around me, from my professor to my doctor, from my friend to my co-student are suggesting me to take a step away from researching and rest.

I have been trying to control myself from compulsively working, distracting myself with video games and stuff. Progress have been made and I started to feel better, physically and mentally. My work can wait and my professor doesn't want ot push me I'm actually ahead of schedule anyway. I took short trips during holidays and this one to Australia is approved by my professor, who said I can take short vacations like this within semester as long as I return as a happier person.

I have been taking part-time job as personal tutor for high school student and hired cosplay date (cosplay as character to go on a date with fans) to support myself financially. This trip is funded by my own savings.

# How we met?

The friendship started online in a group chat of DC's Green Lantern Crops, back in 2021. It's a very uncommon hobby of reading Comics that's originally in English, needless to say about a not-so-popular organisation that even the most popular character among them, Hal Jordan, is eternally destroyed by Ryan Reynolds and his movie of disaster.

Anyway, people in the group chat became friends quickly. After a few months, we mentioned about our locations and found out some of us were in Beijing at the time. So we decided to meet off-line.

Turns out, we were not just in Beijing, but in the same university, Tsinghua University (the best university in China). Tianyao and 【小鳄鱼】 were undergraduate students of Tsinghua at the time and 【夜哥】 were having an exchange semester there. The three of us went out quite frequently. We had drinks together every a few weeks and talked about Green Lantern and other DC characters all the time.

Soon, 【夜哥】 went back to her own school and Tianyao and 【小鳄鱼】 graduated and attended postgraduate programme elsewhere. So the friendship went back to online, where we still discuss DC Comics all the time and feel like we were never apart.

# Why Australia?

## Green Lantern Coaster

As you may have heard of, Warner Bros has built four theme parks around the world, and one of them is in gold coast, Australia, which has a roller coaster themed Green Lantern with the second steepest drop in the world.

Recently, we heard the rumour about Warner Bros may go bankrupt in the next few years. We were all afraid that the famous Green Lantern Coaster in Warner Bros Movie World may close down before we get the chance to ride the one and only roller coaster in the world that's themed after our favourite character. So, we decided to go to Australia before it's too late.

We are not ashamed to say that we are going to Australia for a roller coaster. As you can see in the attached itinerary, it's our first destination and we planned two days for Warner Bros Movie World just to enjoy all DC related sites and souvenir shops.

Yet it would be unwise to travel abroad and solely enjoy a coaster. So we did plan other activities in Australia. Tianyao has a cousin who had visited Gold Coast before. She recommended a combined pass from Paradise Country, which includes three theme parks and itself, in Gold Coast. We planned to visit all three theme parks, plus Dreamworld.

## Comic stores

During Tianyao's last trip across Britain, she developed the habit of scavenger hunting in comic stores. Tianyao collected about 200 comics in Britain, including some very rare and/or meaningful issues, which will be presented in an attached file per her strong request. Of course such collection are tremendously attractive to fellow comic fans like【夜哥】and【小鳄鱼】, so they are joining her this time.

We plan to go all comic stores in Brisbane and Sydney. Brisbane is the closest big city to Gold Coast, and Sydney is the city we will pass anyway. We have already made a list of comic stores in those two cities and plan to visit them all.

## Other activities

Since we plan to stay in Sydney for a whole day, and none of us is interested in taking photos of crowded tourist attractions, we plan to catch a musical, of all musical available during February and March, the Beauty and the Beast seems to be easiest to enjoy. It's very available, so we will make all reservations after getting the visa.

And later that night, we plan to go to a strip club, mostly because of this kind of business being illegal in China mainland. We all have experience of visiting strip clubs, Tianyao in Glasgow, 【夜哥】 and 【小鳄鱼】 in Hongkong, so please trust us when we say we know what we are doing.

# Why we will come back?

## Tianyao Zhu

As I have mentioned before, I have a job waiting for me in Beijing. I believe in the future of my company and myself. I'm confident that I will be much more successful in my career within the coming three years.

Also, my family is in Beijing. I am the only child, so I have the responsibility of my family which I will never abandon. Even the house we are living in is under my name. I have to come back to my family.

## 【小鳄鱼】

I am in between of personal phases. Travelling is how I plan to find myself and Australia is not the first nor the last stop. I suspended my plan of travelling around China for this trip in favour of my friends' timetables. When we finished, I will continue my journey in China.

My parents are being extremely supportive to my decision. I grew up in a warm and loving family. We rely on each other to get through hard times. I will never abandon my family.

## 【夜哥】

I am working on my PhD, which is the primary goal of my life. I have been working on it for 【】 years, ever since I start college, to become a researcher. And I'm not going to give up now. After this trip, I will go back to my school and continue seeing my doctor. As soon as I'm recovered, I can re-devote myself into my research.

I already have my next projecting inlined, which includes working with a subject leader whom I always admire. I'm very excited about it and I won't miss it for any reason.
